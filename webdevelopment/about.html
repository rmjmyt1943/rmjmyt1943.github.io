        <h1> Origin and Meaning of Philo Sé </h1> <!--Maybe add photo of Greek word and Bible-->
            <p>  The Greek word ‘φιλ σε’ <strong>(Philo se)</strong> means ‘I love you.’ That was the Apostle Peter’s answer when Jesus asked him three times, “Do you love Me?” 
                As we are inspired to spread and create a positive environment on campus, our focus is on delivering love.
            <p>Philo Sé Bible Study Club will show convincing proof that  
                <em>Science, World History</em>, and other subjects that seem to contradict the Bible, <strong>support it</strong>.</p>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Love</li>
                <li>Faith</li>
                <li>Hope</li>
                <li>Unity</li>
                <li>Family</li>
            </ul>

                        <p>The power of one person is weak, but if we all work together to solve the problems our campus is facing, the hopeful future of Mizzou will become a reality.  
                    We believe university students are the leaders of future generations who act for the real change of the Earth. 
                    When we come together centered on the love of a Mother, we can make a <strong>difference</strong>. <br>We will devote
                    our efforts in helping change the <em>present despair</em> to <em>future hope</em>, and <em>current frustration</em> to <em>future happiness</em> 
                    on campus by getting more involved.
