        <h1> Where We Started </h1> 
            <p> The Philo Se Bible Study Club started in February 2023. Surprisingly, it started in Kansas City, MO. 
                But we moved to Columbia because Mizzou was slightly bigger than UMKC. 
                We were students who went to the same church off campus and decided to make a difference on campus by bringing awareness to the authenticity of the bible. 
                At first, we would just meet at the student center on campus in the fall of 2022. But we learned we could establish our own club if it’s different than other bible clubs. 
                <strong>Thankfully</strong>, with the help of our advisor, we were able to establish an RSO club on campus. 
            
        <h1> Who Is Involved </h1>
            <p> The Philo Se Bible Study Club is made up of students from various backgrounds. 
                Some students are new to Christianity, while others have been Christians their whole lives. 
                We have students from different majors, including engineering, business, and the arts. 
                What unites us is our passion for learning about the bible and sharing its teachings with others. 
                Our club is open to <strong>all students</strong>, regardless of their faith background. 
                <em>We believe that everyone can benefit from learning about the bible and its teachings.</em>
                We want everyone to participate and understand the glorious work of God. 
                Through this, students can be more joyful and find the purpose in life much faster. 
                Soon, we will branch out to Saint Louis, Springfield, and Kansas City. 
        <h1> What Are The Plans For Growth </h1>

            <p> The Philo Se Bible Study Club has big plans for growth in the future. 
                We plan to expand our club to other campuses in Missouri, including Saint Louis University, 
                University of Missouri-St. Louis, and Missouri State University. 
                We also plan to host more events and activities on campus to promote our club and its mission. 
                We want to create a community of students who are passionate about learning about the bible and sharing its teachings with others. 
                We believe that by expanding our club and hosting more events, we can make a bigger impact on campus and in our community. 
                Our ultimate goal is to plant the love of Christ in everyone's hearts and revive campus through His teachings.
            <p> Many organizations focus on a relationship with Christ; however, we focus on scientific facts, historical events, and scripture-based evidence that will help solidify and build confidence in our relationship with God. 
                We believe unity is important because it could bring a great and positive impact on campus. One way we will grow is by hosting many events that promote unity and care for our community. 
                We want to collaborate with the president of Mizzou to create ideas in helping change the <strong>present despair</strong> to <strong>future hope</strong>, and <strong>current frustration</strong> to <strong>future happiness</strong> on campus by getting more involved. 
                Another plan to grow is by networking with different organizations that focus on the sustainability of the campus. Our ultimate goal is to establish and maintain a club at all the MU system universities.
